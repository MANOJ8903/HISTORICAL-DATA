WeatherPredictor: A Machine Learning-based Weather Prediction System

Overview

WeatherPredictor is a machine learning-based weather prediction system that uses historical weather data to forecast future weather conditions. This project aims to provide accurate and reliable weather predictions, helping users plan their daily activities and make informed decisions.

Features

- *Historical Weather Data*: A comprehensive dataset of historical weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.
- *Machine Learning Model*: A trained machine learning model that uses historical weather data to predict future weather conditions.
- *Weather Forecasting*: The system generates weather forecasts for a specified location and time period.
- *Visualization*: The system provides visualizations of the predicted weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and precipitation.

Technical Details

- *Programming Language*: Python
- *Libraries and Frameworks*: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow or PyTorch for building the machine learning model
- *Data Sources*: Historical weather data from reputable sources such as NOAA or Weather Underground

Getting Started

1. *Clone the Repository*: `git clone https://github.com/username/WeatherPredictor.git`
2. *Install Dependencies*: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. *Run the Application*: `python app.py`

Model Details

- *Model Type*: The system uses a deep learning model, specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, to predict weather conditions.
- *Training Data*: The model is trained on a large dataset of historical weather data.
- *Evaluation Metrics*: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE).
